# 3PieceJSComboWithCries
##Third course challenge focusing on Javascript.

Our task for this challenge is to create a customizable random password generator.
The generator can be run by simply pressing the big red button to begin,
telling the generator how long you'd like the password output to be,
then answering a series of yes/no questions to determine which characters
will be in your new password.

Once completed, the password is pasted into the page for easy copying!
